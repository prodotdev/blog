title: Part 2 - Setting Up Dependency Injection (Hilt)
date: "2022-11-14T00:00:03.000Z"
---

In our demo app, we're not actually making a network request with the `fetchUser()` call to avoid more parts, but if we were, the implementation would still be the same. We'd like to skip calling the real `fetchUser()` in our test, and stub out a response. This way not only are we skipping a request, we'll also have more control within our test.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning on Package Versions

DI requires several packages to work together. If you're just starting your Android app, **I highly recommend you set up DI in the beginning of your project**. Trying to set it up later may require you to try install different versions of packages to find ones that work with your installed `android`, `compose`, `junit` versions.


### Installing Dependencies

We'll need to install 2 sets of dependencies for Hilt:

**1. App dependencies**

Depending on how old this post is when you read this, you may be better off referencing the actual docs here:

https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android#setup

Otherwise, feel free to look at the commit, https://github.com/protrackdev/android-setting-up-ui-tests/commit/81fdad6d63d0a49d080dbd04edd4ebab6503f1e7, to see the dependencies used in this post.

**2. Testing dependencies**

We'll need some dependencies to allow Hilt to swap out our implementation in tests. You can find the docs here:

https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-testing

And the corresponding commit:

https://github.com/protrackdev/android-setting-up-ui-tests/commit/69cbd6bff26ed04fb9ba8cdda4a405dfa85d13b1

#### Summary

This section mostly followed the docs, but here are a few pointers if you get stuck:

- Note that all packages had to have the same version, `2.41` in this case.
- **After installing dependencies, build and run your app to make sure everything still works.**

If you see the following error:

```
The binary version of its metadata is 1.7.1, expected version is 1.5.1.
```

You may be installing hilt dependencies that use a later version of `kotlin` than the one you have installed. Try installing older versions of hilt (and related) packages.

### Using DI in our App

Before we dive in to actually using DI, there's one point clear up: **in a compose app, you use DI to inject classes into view models**. In our case we'll be injecting `AuthService` into our `UserViewModel` as a dependency.

**1. Create and register an `Application` class**

We first need to annotate our `Application` as a `@HiltAndroidApp` for the DI to work. Compose doesn't come with one, so we'll create a new `Application` file:

```kotlin
package dev.protrack.uitestapp

import android.app.Application
import dagger.hilt.android.HiltAndroidApp

@HiltAndroidApp
class UITestApplication: Application()
```

Next we need to tell Android to use `UITestApplication` as our `Application` class:

**AndroidManifest.xml**

```xml
<manifest>
    <application
            ...
            android:name=".UITestApplication"
            >
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

**2. Set `MainActivity` as `@AndroidEntryPoint`**

Pretty self-explanatory, but we need to tell Hilt which is our starting activity.

```kotlin
@AndroidEntryPoint
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    ...
}
```
**3. Update our `UserViewModel` to receive injected `AuthService`**

Currently we're instantiating our `authService` directly, inside the view model:

```kotlin

class UserViewModel : ViewModel() {
  val authService = AuthService()
  ...
}
```

- `AuthService()` will be created each time `UserViewModel` is created.
- `UserViewModel` knows explicitly how to create an instance of `AuthService`. In this case there are no arguments required, but if there were, they would have to be passed in here.

Now that we have DI, let's ask Hilt to inject `AuthService` instead:

```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class UserViewModel @Inject constructor(private val authService: AuthService) : ViewModel() {

    var name = mutableStateOf("No User")

    fun load() {
        name.value = authService.fetchUser()
    }
}
```

- Annotated with `@HiltViewModel`.
- We're asking for a `AuthService`, but we're not actually instantiating it.
- The rest of the code is unchanged.

If you tried to build, and run the app now, it will explode unceremoniously, and your editor may look like this:

![compiler error](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f9s8bef1p70r9q2h1bzk.png)

Don't get thrown off by the generated `.java` file, or the `SingletonC` class. The only error that matters is this: `Dagger/MissingBinding`. Of course the app crashed, we haven't told Hilt how to create our `AuthService`! Let's do that next.

**4. Providing Dependencies**

To tell Hilt how to create our dependencies, we need to define them in a 'module':

**AuthModules.kt** 

```kotlin
@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
internal object AuthModules {
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideAuthService(): AuthService {
        return AuthService()
    }
}
```

- `@Module` to tell Hilt that this is a module. Which really just means it's a class that will define how to create dependencies. 
- `@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)`, and `@Singleton` to tell Hilt, we only want `AuthService` to be a singleton. You can also use `@InstallIn(ViewModelComponent::class)`/`@ViewModelScoped` to have each view model have their own instance.
- `@Provides` says the following function is going to instantiate a dependency.

If you run the app now, you should see that it works again! üéâ üéâ üéâ  We still see **Real User** on the screen, except now we're getting it via DI!

### Updating Tests to Use DI

If you tried to run our `GetUserTest` again, you'll see that it.... fails ‚ùå:

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot create an instance of class dev.protrack.uitestapp.UserViewModel
```

Yep. We need to tell our test runner that we're using Hilt. Yay, more boilerplate! 


**1. Create a `HiltTestRunner`**

Similar to what we had to do with `Application`, we need to tell the test runner, `junit`, to use a `HiltTestApplication` for tests.

Create the following file inside your **androidTest** directory:

**HiltTestRunner.kt**

```kotlin
class HiltTestRunner: AndroidJUnitRunner() {
    override fun newApplication(cl: ClassLoader?, name: String?, context: Context?): Application {
        return super.newApplication(cl, HiltTestApplication::class.java.name, context)
    }
}
```

- We're overriding the default `newApplication`, and sending through a `HiltTestApplication` instead.


**2. Register our `HiltTestRunner`**

**app/build.gradle**

```
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        testInstrumentationRunner = "dev.protrack.uitestapp.HiltTestRunner"
    }

  ...
}
```

- The package identifier, **dev.protrack.uitestapp**, needs to match the one on top of **HiltTestRunner**.

**3. Update Test to be a `@HiltAndroidTest` 

We'll now update our test to one that can handle DI.


**GetUserTest.kt**

```kotlin
@HiltAndroidTest
class GetUserTest {

    @get:Rule(order = 0)
    val hiltRule = HiltAndroidRule(this)

    @get:Rule(order = 1)
    val composeTestRule = createAndroidComposeRule<MainActivity>()

   @Test
   fun it_shows_user_name() {
       composeTestRule.setContent {
           HomeScreen()
       }

       composeTestRule.onNodeWithText("Real User").assertIsDisplayed()
   }
}
```

- Need multiple `@get:Rule` so we'll need to use `order`.
- `val hiltRule = HiltAndroidRule(this)` is required (to manage component state).
- We still have a compose rule, but it now needs to know our activity, `createAndroidComposeRule<MainActivity>()`.
- The rest of the test is unchanged.

Go ahead, run the test again, and you'll see that sweet ‚úÖ... and we're back to square one. You may be thinking that was a whole bunch of code, and steps just to get back to where we started, you're not wrong, but I promise it's about to get better. Let's look at how we can replace dependencies in our tests next.
